> Current workflow: follow the repository-root AGENTS.md and README.md. Use the root workspace lockfile and `node scripts/prepare-game.mjs <slug>` / `node scripts/check-game.mjs <slug>` from the root. Imported standalone setup, sibling-checkout, Homebrew and Mac scratch instructions below are historical; they are not prerequisites for the current build or CI. Game rules and evidence requirements below still apply.

# Commonstead

Follow the [games workspace instructions](../../AGENTS.md) and [handoff](../../HANDOFF.md) first. The workspace registry and lockfile own package pins, builds and deployment; this file retains game-specific requirements.

Authority: docs/concept.md. Done means the deployable vertical slice and evidence listed there; owner accepts after playing. Do not change human-framework or the lab index. Signed commits with Co-Authored-By: Codex <noreply@openai.com>. Run pnpm run check:lane before commits. No secrets in source or output. One browser. Stop under 5 GB free. Native simulation owns world only; HF owns people. Deferred work has a date in concept.md.

Commonstead is being ported to the public HF4 shared Run protocol. The public HF runtime and nested lab-client dependency pin published HF 4.17.0. Immutable lab-client 0.5.16 and lab-kit 0.5.33 come from their released artifacts. Technical delivery requires hosted review, exact merged CI and a matching clean release manifest. Owner acceptance remains separate.

Use [the plain-English policy](docs/lab/plain-english.md) for player text.

TypeScript support is 7+. Use `pnpm run check:lane` before every commit; it runs lint and types without the shared suite lock. Run focused tests and a bounded headless control. Hosted CI runs the full suite and build. Suite-lock maintenance delivered in 1e22d9a (CI 40242664724) fails closed after six unreadable-owner observations without deleting the unidentified lock. Lab-panel rounds are allowed under the playtest director. Friends’ playtests and Show HN remain paused. Technical delivery does not imply owner acceptance.

Use shared Node 26.12.0 and pnpm 12.16.1. Install with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`. Preserve strict engines and peers, no hoisting, shared-store hardlinks, the one-day third-party release age and version-specific build approvals in pnpm-workspace.yaml. Do not download a project runtime.

The current HF4.17.0/client0.5.19/kit0.5.36 graph uses the released portable peer gate. Unknown peer status blocks portable writes. Per-person admission skips unsupported histories without claiming them. Durable preparation, local/file continuation and read-only exact-current-head recovery remain available. Live peer verification and missing shared contracts stay separate; see docs/cast-adoption.md.

Native carryover (historical mechanism contract): every native edition automatically checks supported shelf people. Settlement and roof/yield checkpoints use actual action and world-obligation boundaries; no edition-wide refusal. Keep unsupported-duty validation, ownership CAS, complete source archives, existing replay hashes and file-session isolation. See docs/cast-adoption.md.

Biome 2.6.5 keeps formatter exclusions only for the historical report paths listed in biome.json, preserving their evidence text and layout. Lint still applies to those files.

Stack (2026-11-05): HF 4.17.0, Node 26.12.0, pnpm 12.16.1, TypeScript 7.0.2, Vite 8.3.5, Vitest 5.1.0, Biome 2.6.5, Wrangler 4.157.0; Worker compatibility date 2026-11-05.
